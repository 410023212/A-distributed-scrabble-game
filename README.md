# A-distributed-scrabble-game
In this project, we designed and achieved a distributed scrabble game. When the client user connects with the game server, he(she) can see the other users, if he wants to start a new game with other users, he can invite them by choosing usernames in left membership list. Once he clicks the start game button, a scrabble game will start. During your own turn, you can only insert letter in same row or same column. If you think you finished a right word, you can apply for vote, after all users agree, you will get marks. When all users pass without successfully applying for vote, or when any user exists, this game will end and all users can see the results. The two fundamental technologies used in the distributed game are sockets and threads.
